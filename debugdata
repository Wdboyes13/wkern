Note: These attempts were isolated and run one at a time - disabling the last before trying the next

Loading hanging handler BEFORE the PIT handler - Still Boot-Loop
Not loading IRQ0 handler at all but loading hanging handler - Boot Loop
Never setting up PIT but enabling STI - Boot-Loop
Masking ALL IRQs before calling STI - Boot-Loop
Calling INT $3 immediatly after STI - Boot-Loop
Removing tick counter ++ - Boot-Loop
Dummy Handler - Boot-Loop
Not initializing the PIT and disabling all handlers as well as masking all IRQs - Gets passed STI and actually executes 2 print functions, but when it reaches get input, bootloop (input likely unrelated)
Same but with dummy handler - Exact same result
